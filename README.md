Title: "Guessing Game"

This is a web page that asks three Yes/No questions of the user. It checks to
see if the answer is correct, then alerts the user as to whether that's true. It
keeps a counter to track how many of the those the user got correct, then gives
out that information when those three are done.

It then asks a question with a numerical answer, and loops until the user gives
a correct response.

We added id tags to the html and removed all alert messages. Also added functions
to our program. Runs smooth.

Put questions and respones into arrays. Function into a loop. Cut out redundant code.
